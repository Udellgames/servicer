# Servicer
A simple type-safe, generic service locator.

This repository is automatically built against the following versions of Mono:
  - beta
  - latest
  - 3.10.0
  - 3.8.0
  - 3.2.8
  - 2.10.8
  
Additionally, the solution was written targeting .NET 3.5. It should work with any version higher than or equal to 3.5, but cannot currently be continuously tested against .NET.
  
Any versions before Mono 2.10.8 are not supported. Nightly / Alpha builds of Mono are not supported, but should work.
